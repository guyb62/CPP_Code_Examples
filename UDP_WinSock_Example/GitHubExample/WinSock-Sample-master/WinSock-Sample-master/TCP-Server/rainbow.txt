"Rainbow In The Dark" - Dio

When there's lightning,
You know, it always brings me down.
'Cause it's free,
And I see
That it's me
Who's lost and never found.

I cry out for magic,
See it dancing in the light.
It was cold.
Lost my hold
To the shadows of the night.

No sign of the morning coming.
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark.

Do your demons—well, do they ever let you go?
When you've tried,
Do they hide
Deep inside?
Is it someone that you know?

We're just a picture.
We're an image caught in time.
We're a lie:
You and I.
We're words without a rhyme.

No sign of the morning coming.
Don't you be left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark.
Rainbow in the dark.
Yeah.

When there's lightning,
You know, it always brings me down.
'Cause it's free,
And I see
That it's me
Who's lost and never found.

I cry out for magic,
See it floating in the air.
It was fear,
And you'll hear it
Calling you, "Beware! Look out!"

No sign of the morning coming,
No sight of the day.
You've been left on your own.
You are a rainbow,
Rainbow in the dark. [3x]

A rainbow in the dark.
Too many mornings.
Oh, just rainbow in the dark, dark, dark.

I see you're all—you're all—you're all rainbows.
You are rainbows in the dark.
